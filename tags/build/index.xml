&lt;a href="https://clarkkromenaker.com/post/library-dynamic-loading-mac">a post&lt;/a> about wrangling dynamic libraries for Mac applications. I recently faced the same challenge on Linux, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write a follow up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re new to dealing with dynamic libraries, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reviewing the previous post first - it covers some fundamentals that I won&amp;rsquo;t rehash here. Linux and Mac handle dynamic libraries in similar ways - but as you might guess, the tools used and some details vary.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Loading Dynamic Libraries on Mac</title><link>https://clarkkromenaker.com/post/library-dynamic-loading-mac/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>kromenak@gmail.com (Clark Kromenaker)</author><guid>https://clarkkromenaker.com/post/library-dynamic-loading-mac/</guid><description>&lt;p>G-Engine uses various third-party libraries: ffmpeg for video playback, fmod for audio playback, zlib for decompression, etc. In all these cases, the library is included as a &amp;ldquo;dynamic library&amp;rdquo; (as opposed to a &amp;ldquo;static library&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Windows, when an executable needs a dynamic library, it searches for it in a few predefined locations, such as &amp;ldquo;the same directory as the executable&amp;rdquo;. On Mac and Linux, however, the situation is different and requires some consideration and explanation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was recently learning how macOS loads dynamic libraries, and it is not as intuitive or well documented as you might hope. This post attempts to lay things out in a clear and easy to digest way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
